Algebraic ring structures

*Note:* Ring requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation

Before installing the package, please ensure that `gcc` and `gfortran` are 
available.
On OS X, these are both installed with `brew install gcc`;
users of Anaconda may want to instead consider `conda install gcc`.
On Linux, `gcc` is most likely already available, and `gfortran` can be
installed with `apt-get install gfortran`.
Then simply

```
pip install ring
```

## Manual

Coming soon.
